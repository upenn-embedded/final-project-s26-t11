## Final Project Proposal

### 1. Abstract

B.A.T.R.A. is an automated two-axis IMU-stabilized camera gimble with joystick control. An inertial measurement unit continuously determines the camera's orientation and a PID control algorithm drives two servo motors to keep the camera stable. An analog joystick is used by the operator to set the horizontal and vertical viewing angle. Bare metal C firmware on an ATmega328PB is used to maintain the set angle.

### 2. Motivation

Any time you watch a smooth aerial drone shot, use a handheld camera without a nauseating shake, or watch a robot navigate a warehouse, there is some kind of video stabilization system working behind the scences. Video stabilization was always essential for high quality videos or movies, but now it has become crucial for computer vision applications where stable video makes consistent object detection possible.

Although video gimbals aren't a nieche topic, the process of desiging a gimbal is very application specific and tackles the core challenge of decreasing the noise in input data.

### 5. Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

The software for B.A.T.R.A. is responsible for reading sensor data, running the stabilization control loop, processing user input on the joy stick, and driving the servo motor output. All of this is meant to be done in real time on an ATmega328PB running bare metal C.

| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SRS-01 | The firmware shall read 3-axis acceleration data and 3-axis gyroscope data from the IMU over I2C at a rate of 100 Hz +/- 10 Hz.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| SRS-02 | The firmware shall sample the 2 ADC channels recording data from the 2 axes of the joystick at a rate of at least 50 Hz and have a dead region at +/- 5% of the sensor range around the joystick sensor to prevent "stick drift".                                                                                                                 |
| SRS-03 | The firmware shall complete a PID control loop for each axis at least every 10 ms +/- 2 ms. This loop involves computing the corrective commands send to the servo motors from the error between measured and desired angle.                                                                                                                      |
| SRS-04 | The firmware shall generate the PWM signals for the two servo motors with PWM ranges from 1 ms to 2 ms, corresponding to the angular range of the servo motors.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| SRS-05 | The firmware shall support two operating modes. One mode is a stabilized hold where the current pitch and roll angles are maintained, and the other mode is where a joystick is used sets the desired stabilization angle<br />(and thus the camera position can be controlled from the joystick). The modes can be selected using a mode button. |
| SRS-06 | When the mode select button is held for at least 1 second, the firmware shall level out the platform within 2 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| SRS-07 | The stabilization firmware shall reject any disturbances of +/- 15 degrees in the roll or pitch and return the platform to +/- 3 degrees of te requested roll/pitch within 500 ms.                                                                                                                                                                |
